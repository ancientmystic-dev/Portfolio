### What is a Case journey?
Whenever a person requires a transplant or an oncology treatment he submits his case for review. Any case submitted on the platform starts from the initial evaluation and ends at the post-transplant phase. Each phase consists of multiple sub-phases and each sub-phase has forms/checklists that need to be filled before moving to the next phase.


### Goals
- Easy access to all the checklists and forms that need to be filled.
- Easy to navigate within sections of a form.
- Reduce the time to fill the form.
- Make the transition between phases and subphases easier.
